# Colorize

Accessibility tool that helps those with color blindess to distinguish colors by applying a daltonization filter to images.

Colorize allows colorblind users to distinguish colors by correcting for their type of color vision deficiency (Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia). 

Users can also increase saturation of images on the Chrome browser to more clearly differentiate colors.

Colorize works by utilizing the LMS Daltonization Algorithm. The idea of the algorithm is to convert the RGB values into LMS, 
compensate for the values that are being lost from the type of color blindness, and convert the values back using the CVD matrix. 
This method is notable for being the most accurate in correcting for color blindness.

Works on websites like Google Images, YouTube, Pinterest and countless others. Available in all regions.
